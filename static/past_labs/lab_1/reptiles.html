            <h2>Lizard</h2>
            <p>Most lizards are quadrupedal, running with a strong side-to-side 
            motion. Some lineages (known as "legless lizards"), have secondarily 
            lost their legs, and have long snake-like bodies. Some such as the 
            forest-dwelling Draco lizards are able to glide.</p>

            <h2>Gecko</h2>
            <p>Geckos are unique among lizards for their vocalisations, which 
            differ from species to species. Most geckos in the family Gekkonidae 
            use chirping or clicking sounds in their social interactions. Tokay 
            geckos are known for their loud mating calls, and some other species
            are capable of making hissing noises when alarmed or threatened.</p>
