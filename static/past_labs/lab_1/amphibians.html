            <h2>Frog</h2>
            <p>An adult frog has a stout body, protruding eyes, anteriorly-attached
            tongue, limbs folded underneath, and no tail. Frogs have glandular 
            skin, with secretions ranging from distasteful to toxic.</p>

            <h2>Salamander</h2>
            <p>Salamanders rarely have more than four toes on their front legs and
            five on their rear legs, but some species have fewer digits and others
            lack hind limbs. Their permeable skin usually makes them reliant 
            on habitats in or near water or other cool, damp places.</p>
